*** Cut and paste the for loop here ***

{% for message in messages %}
                              {{message}}
                         {% endfor %}

*** What is the for loop doing? ***

It is giving a conditional statement -- for a certain case it is telling the command to perform the command 'message' and for all other cases to perform a different command.
